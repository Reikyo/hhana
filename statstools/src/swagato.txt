please note an important caveat : that script will work if you used Aaron's
edit_workspaces infrastructure to embed the conditional and unconditional
snapshots at the workspace creation level, and that asimovData_1 is created by
fitting to data.

Please note that hist2workspace makes AsimovData without fitting to data.
If working on histfactory [or measurment] based blind workspaces, then one
should not pre-load additional snapshots and really all one needs to do is

 firstPOI->setVal(0);
 ProfileLikelihoodTestStat testStat(*pdf);
 testStat.SetOneSided(true); 
 double value = 2*testStat.Evaluate(*data,*poi);

where you should use AsimovData from hist2workspace command but re-created on
the fly with mu set to 1. However, for limit code, this mu should be reset to
0 and that AsimovData should be used.

After unblinding, one has to of course fit to data.

also, please do not do

     if (emb) emb->setVal(0.7);

That was special requirement during ICHEP12, to avoid double minima
